# albatross-compiler

The latest project I have worked on. It is a compiler designed to translate the Albatross language into assembly instructions. It was developed under the guidance, and around the body of code provided by Luis Pina (instructor), for the CS 473 course in the University of Illinois-Chicago.

Here is a list of the files with code co-authored by me and Prof. Pina:
<ul>
<li>ast_to_ir.c</li>
<li>frames.c</li>
<li>ir_tree_to_list.c</li>
<li>lexer.lex</li>
<li>parser.y</li>
<li>semantic_analysis_symbols.c</li>
<li>semantic_analysis_types.c</li>
<li>transform.c</li>
</ul>
